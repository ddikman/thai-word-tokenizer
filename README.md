# Thai Word Tokenizer on JavaScript

This is a Thai word segmentation on JavaScript.

The approach of this project is simply longest matching algorithm.

The algorithm compare string with words in a dictionary and select the longest word found as a result.

Since the program relies on very basic algorithm, it cannot handle abiguity problem properly, so beware of the applications.
