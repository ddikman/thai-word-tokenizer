# Thai Word Tokenizer on JavaScript

This is a fork of the [thai-word-sgementation](https://github.com/sertiscorp/thai-word-segmentation) repository. I made it to be able to call the functionality as an API.

The site/api is hosted at:
https://thai-word-tokenizer.vercel.app/


You can call the API with a query string just by accessing:
